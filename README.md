hello
 I am often labeled as asian, male, and quite. Then other labels would be dog lover, antisocial, snob, or unapproachable. Additionally, I get asked about my age. I still get carded every time I order a drink and the waiter/ waitress would make a comment. One main label I believe that is important to me is dog lover. I grew up with dogs and love everything about them. They are truly a manâ€™s bestfriend.
